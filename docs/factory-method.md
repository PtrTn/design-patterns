# Usage
Use the factory method pattern when:
- You want to create an implementation of an interface
- You want to delegate the logic of which implementation should be created

# Implementation
1. Create at least two implementation with the same interface
3. Create a factory with a method returning the interface
4. Implement the factory method with logic to determine which interface implementation should be returned
